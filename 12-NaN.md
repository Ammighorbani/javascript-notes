# NaN: Not a Number

### Note: 
**If we append a "Number" data type to "String" data type the concat will happen.**

### Example: 

**Inpute:**
```
"hi" + 1 
```

**Output:**
```
"hi1"
```

### Note: 
**But we can't to Subtraction operation one "Number" data type of "String" data type.**

### Example: 

**Inpute:**
```
"hi" - 1
```

**Output:**
```
NaN
```

### Note: 
**If we use other mathematics operations for "Strings" or text we will receive "NaN" error.**

### Note: 
**But if our "String" data type isn't text and in our "String" we have a number look like "12" and do total operation and we append a "Number" data type to it concat again will happen but if we do other mathematic operations that operation will happen correctly.**

### Example: 

**Inpute:**
```
alert("12" - 1)
```

**Output:**
```
11
```

### Note: 
**NaN data type is "Number".**
