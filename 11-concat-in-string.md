# Concat in Strgins:

### "+" : 
**We use plus to show more than one variable in alert method.**

### Example: `alert(Num1 + Num2)`

### Note: 
**Because it doesn't have space between to variable we must to add it like this.**

### Example: `alert(siteName + " " + courseName)`

### "\n": 
**We use it to show our variables in different lines.**

### Example: `alert(siteName + "\n" + courseName)`

### Example: `alert("site:" + siteName + "\n" + "course:" + courseName)`

### Note: 
**If we want to use quotation mark in alert we must to use back slash behind each quotation.**

### Example: `alert("this is \"javascript\" course from sabzlearn")`
