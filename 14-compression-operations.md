# Compression Operations

### "==" : 
**It will check our numbers is equal or not.**

### Example: 

**Inpute:**
```
alert(3 == 3)
```
**Output:**
```
true
```

### "<,>" : 
**It will check is one of our numbers is bigger than other one or not.**

### Example:
**Inpute:**
```
alert(4 > 3)
```

**Output:**
```
true
```

### Note: 
**If we have an String and in our String we have number 3 and we compression it with Number 3 with "==" we will get true because the "==" will only check the elements for value not for data types.**

### Example: 

**Inpute:**
```
alert("3" == 3) 
```

**Output:**
```
true
```

### "===" : 
**In the first step it will check the variables for their data type and then in the second step it will check it for their value if both of them be "true" we will receive true if one of them is false we will receive false.**

### Example: 

**Inpute:**
```
alert("3" === 3)
```

**Output:**
```
false
```

### Example: 
**Inpute:**
```
alert(3 === 3)
```

**Output:**
```
true
```
