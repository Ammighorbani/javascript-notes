# "find"

### Before this session we learn about "some" method this method only check is our method in our "object" or "Array" or not and after that we learned about "findindex" and this method if find our object only will get back that object index in our "object" or "Array" but this method if find our object will get back everything about it.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
var users = [

    {id: 1, name: "amir", age: 19},
    {id: 2, name: "babak", age: 29},
    {id: 3, name: "amin", age: 22},

]

users.find(function(user) {

    return user.name === "amin"

})
```

**Output:**
```
{id: 2, name: "babak", age: 29}
```
