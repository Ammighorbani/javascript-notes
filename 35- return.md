# return 

### Note: 

**If we "alert" something it will only show for us and done and after that we can't do anything with that value but if we use "return" we can use that value again in our codes.**

### Example:

```
var num1 = Number(prompt("Enter your first number"))

var num2 = Number(prompt("Enter your second number"))

function showresault (num1,num2) {
	return num1 + num2
}

var showend = showresault(num1, num2)
alert(showend)
```

### Note: 

**Now we insert the returned data into showend variable and now we can alert that data and at the same time we have that data and we can make change on it and use it later.**

### Note: 
**Each function can have only one "return."**

### Note: 
**In function if the "return" start and run that line after that we will comes out of that function and codes after "return" won't run.**
